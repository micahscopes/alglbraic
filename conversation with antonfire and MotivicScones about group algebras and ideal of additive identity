<drazak> well, if W is an invariant subspace with basis v_1, v_2, ..., v_w, and we extend this to a basis for V, adding v_w+1, ..., v_n then we can write the matrix for whatever the operator is with a wxw matrix at the top left with all 0's under it

<antonfire> it behaves fine under scaling, you already checked that
* waka (~wakariera@unaffiliated/waka) has joined ##math
<antonfire> this was supposed to be an extension of a given function U -> U, so you should check if it at least does what it's supposed to on U before you start drawing conclusions from it.

* Notafed (~douseiais@185.21.216.185) has joined ##math
<MotivicScones> that's literally the exact opposite of okay.
<zwisch> the original question was this:
<zwisch> Let U be the subset {(x:y:z)|z!=0} of RP(2). Does the map U->U taking (x:y:1) to (x^2*y:x:1) extend to a smooth map f:RP(2)->RP(2) ?
<randomA> so other than that h should be g, how does this not show that g is one-to-one since g is one-to-one from the definition
<antonfire> pretty sure you said (x^2:y:1) earlier, not (x^2*y:x:1).
<drazak> antonfire: uh, is there a set of properties that uniquely determines if B is the transpose of A, other than looking at th a_ij and b_ij
<zwisch> yeah that was a typo, I amended it
<antonfire> ah.
* psy_ has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
<MotivicScones> randomA: you never actually show that g is one-to-one -- you just assert it and then write some completely irrelevant stuff
<MotivicScones> which suggests you don't know what "one-to-one" means
<MotivicScones> in which case I recommend looking it up
<zwisch> I mean is this question just silly? Cause that's not a well define function
<antonfire> in that case, yes, the thing you're talking about does what it was supposed to do on U.
<antonfire> It seems to fuck up at two points in RP(2) which you already mentioned.
<antonfire> so, like I said, can you "patch it" at those two points, or is the fuck-up unfixable?
<drazak> is it not ok to just definite it on RP(2)\{(0;1;0),(1;0,0)}

<MotivicScones> the inverse of the identity element is the identity element
* nForce has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.4)
<MotivicScones> but -1 isn't the inverse of the identity element
<antonfire> also, to answer your question, the transpose of a matrix corresponding to a map f:V->W is the matrix corresponding to the adjoint map f*:V*->W*.
<MotivicScones> remember, the minus sign is just notation here -- it doesn't mean "additive inverse", because there's no addition operation in the quaternion group

<MotivicScones> randomA: it's technically better in that some of the sentences are talking about something that vaguely resembles the definition of one-to-one, but you haven't actually proved that it's one-to-one (or in your notation, that b_1 = b_2) -- you just assert it without justification
<antonfire> like, if you want to distinguish between matrices and linear maps, then you don't need to do every definition twice, you can exploit the relationship between them.

* PinkTieGuy has quit (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
<antonfire> To patch it at one point, all you have to do is say what f( (1:0:0) ) maps to.

* karly (~Daddy@cpe-104-172-86-219.socal.res.rr.com) has joined ##math
<antonfire> This pretty much forces your hand, and the question is whether it forces your hand to pick some specific value for f( (1:0:0) ) or it forces you to give up entirely.
<antonfire> You know what f does to points of RP(2) that are close to (1:0:0).
<randomA> so i should say that there is only one b in B for one a in A so if a1 = a2 then b1 = b2
<zwisch> that's what I'm trying to figure out anton
<MotivicScones> randomA: that's what you're trying to show
<antonfire> Does it map points that are close to (1:0:0) to points that are all close to some other point in RP(0)?
<MotivicScones> so don't just *say* that -- *prove* it
<antonfire> If so, you have to define f( (1:0:0) ) to be that point.
<antonfire> Does it map points that are close to (1:0:0) kind of all over the place?
* WHAT_UP (~ffs@171.66.208.139) has joined ##math

<antonfire> So pick a variety of points of RP(2) near (1:0:0) and see what f does to them.
<randomA> there is only one b in B for one a in A because the definition of g is that for every b there is one a, and because g is derived from f, for every a there is only one b.
<zwisch> ok, I'm gonna try
<randomA> because f was onto
<antonfire> Since you kind of "made up" the values of f at points of the form (x:y:0), but the values of f at points of the form (x:y:z) with z != 0 was set in stone from the beginning, you might want to focus on points of the latter form.

<antonfire> think about how you would put this sort of argument for a function R->R on a rigorous foundation.
<antonfire> You have a function defined on some subset of R, you want to see whether it extends to a (smooth, continuous, whatever) function on a larger set
<zwisch> in that case I would use the continuity of f
<antonfire> sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
* Cabanossi has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)

<zwisch> that would entail going from coordinate space to the manifold through f and back to the coordinate space right?
* Cabanossi (~Cabanossi@p5DD7ACA7.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined ##math
<antonfire> depends on just how you happen to define the topology on RP(2).
<zwisch> I have the definition of a smooth function between manifolds in front of me
<antonfire> if you're just using the quotient topology, then the charts have nothing to do with it.
<zwisch> I just have no intuitive grasp for it
<antonfire> er
<antonfire> nothing to do with continuity.
<randomA> http://mathb.in/51679 is this more right?
<antonfire> And I recommend that you first work out whether the thing you're given even extends to a continuous function RP(2) -> RP(2) and worry about charts and smoothness later.
* wolfcub has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
<zwisch> we're using the canonical charts sending e.g. (x:y:z) to (x/z, y/z)

<zwisch> all sequences converging to 0 in the domain converge to 0 in the codomain so we can patch it with f(0)-0

<micahf> MotivicScones, I see why I was getting confused now, it's because the "inverse()" function in sage wasn't thinking of the same inverse as me. Sage represents the identity element as () and the "order 2 element" as (1,3)(2,4)(5,7)(6,8)

<MotivicScones> antonfire: oh, nice examples
<zwisch> ok anton, how about this; let's use the chart (V,psi) where V={(x:y:z)|x!=0} is a subset of RP(2) and psi takes (1:x:y) to (x,y). So here the point (1:0:0) corresponds to (0,0) in R^2. Then, since the function f has to take (x:y:z) to (x^2*y:x*z^2:z^3) we have that any point close to (0,0), e.g. (d,e) gets sent to (1:d:e) through psi^-1, to (d,e^2,e^3) through f, and to (e^2/d, e^3/d) through psi
<micahf> antonfire: yeah those are very good examples
<zwisch> is this anything close to being the right way to approach this?

* mmango has quit (Quit: Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
<antonfire> The question is whether you can patch that and decide on a correct way for the line in your right hand to point in that situation.
<zwisch> so it cannot be continuous there?
<zwisch> I mean not defined there continuously
<zwisch> if it behaves wildly for lines close to (1:0:0) I don't see how you could patch it
<antonfire> okay, so is it acutally behaving wildly?
<zwisch> from what I've gathered so far it is
<antonfire> if you wiggle the line in your left hand around a bit while keeping it close to (1:0:0) does the line in your right hand go all over the place?
<antonfire> if so, you should be able to picture (and then write down) points close to (1:0:0) for which the values of f at those points are nowhere near each other.
<antonfire> So you're in the "x/|x|" situation, and you can make a precise argument that way.
<zwisch> ok. I'm curious why you said I shouldn't use psi again after coming back through f
<antonfire> because stuff you already said has already suggested a possible suitable value for f( (1:0:0) ).
<antonfire> And that value isn't covered by the chart psi.

<antonfire> Use whatever charts you think are appropriate for this, if any.

<brett011479> is there an nice formula for the distance between a point and a line in the p-norm?
<zwisch> suppose f doesn't converge for sequences approaching (1:0:0), in that case would Ihave to check it in every chart?
<brett011479> or more generally, a point and a hyperplane
<antonfire> in that case, you don't have to think about charts at all
<antonfire> because you don't have to think about smoothness at all

<zwisch> heh what I mean was if f doesn't converge and I didn't know it
<antonfire> if you know f(p) doesn't converge to some point in RP(2) as p approaches (1:0:0), then you know f can't be extended continuously to RP(2).
<noob__> how does this thing work btw/
<zwisch> like if I was trying to show that fact
<antonfire> you mean how you would prove that f(p_n) doesn't always converge in the first place if p_n is a sequence approaching (1:0:0)?
<zwisch> yes
* GodEmperorFrigo (~Frigo@catv-80-99-5-67.catv.broadband.hu) has joined ##math
<antonfire> you would write down a sequence p_n converging to (1:0:0) for which f(p_n) doesn't converge.

<antonfire> i.e. this is mechanical.
<zwisch> yeah all this stuff is new to me, so the proof mechanics are something I have to flesh out
<antonfire> I dunno, my impression is that everything I've said is pretty much the obvious thing to think about.
<zwisch> hmm
<antonfire> this is working completely by analogy to what you would do to answer a similar question for more familiar sorts of functions
<antonfire> e.g. functions R -> R or R^2 -> R^2.
<zwisch> I see why you would say so
<zwisch> yes, so how would I show f(p_n) doesn't converge?
<antonfire> how would you do it if you were dealing with a function R -> R or R^2 -> R^2?
<zwisch> show that the sequence isn't cauchy
<zwisch> or something
<antonfire> and yeah, you could do the same sort of thing with RP(2), but you'd need a metric.
<zwisch> yeah that's a whole nother ball of wax
* arubi_ (~ese168@unaffiliated/arubi) has joined ##math
<antonfire> so how would you show that a given sequence in R, or in R^2 doesn't converge, without this "cauchy" thing
* Jellydog has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
<antonfire> note that you have some freedom in picking p_n and hence f(p_n) in the first place.

<antonfire> sounds like you're well-equipped to find lots of points near (1:0:0) that f maps to things that are far apart from each other, then.
<zwisch> what caught me off guard though is that you said going back through psi is not sufficient. Supposedly, this means going back through theta is also not sufficient and I have to check every chart?
<zwisch> that doesn't seem right to me
